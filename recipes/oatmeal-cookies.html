    <h2>Oatmeal Cookies</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt (use a pinch if using salted butter)</li>
        <li>¾ cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt, for finishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong>
            In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter with the granulated sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla; mix until smooth.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Add the dry ingredients:</strong>
            In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add this mixture to the wet ingredients and mix on low just until a soft dough forms.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Fold in the oats and chocolate:</strong>
            Stir in the oats, then fold in the chocolate chips.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Chill:</strong>
            Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour to help control spreading and create those thin, crisp edges.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong>
            Preheat the oven to 350°F. Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough, roll into balls, and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving several inches between each one (they spread quite a bit). Bake 12–15 minutes, or until the edges are deeply golden and the centers still look slightly soft.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Finish with sea salt:</strong>
            While the cookies are warm on the baking sheet, sprinkle a small pinch of flaky sea salt on top of each one. Let them rest for a minute before transferring them to a cooling rack.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Cool:</strong>
            The cookies will crisp as they cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
